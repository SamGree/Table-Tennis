## Inspiration
The genesis of Table Tennis Pro stems from a deeply personal source - my son. Over the past two years, witnessing his dedication and triumphs in the world of ping pong has been nothing short of inspiring. His collection of trophies is a testament to his commitment and passion for the sport.

## Journey
Motivated by his journey, I decided to immerse myself in the world of table tennis. I joined his club, and what started as a supportive parent soon turned into a personal fascination. The intricacies of focus and technique involved in every match fascinated me, driving me to delve deeper into the sport.
